Social Data Model

## Introduction

The documentation here describes a conceptual data model that can be used to describe social phenomena and includes types of social activities and relationships that involve persons.

The data model facilitates the description of events in a personâ€™s life. The events provide context to relationships that the person has to other people, documents, groups, organisations as well as the events and their locations.

For an event, the event is described as being an instance of a type of activity, and the participants of the event optionally have a role associated with them, where the role is relevant to the type of activity. The event has a time and location associated with it.
